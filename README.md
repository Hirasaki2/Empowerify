This addon is to allow for a slight modification to the website 
"empowerlearning.net" and is meant to be an improvement to the end user.

This addon was just for one school but has branched to 
support other schools.

The "Redirect" option is for using the 2018 theme of empower which 
was more useful.

The "Go Back Catcher" option is to allow the website to give a warning 
when the user accidentially presses the back arrow of the browser instead
of the "X" in the page.
